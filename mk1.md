summary

With tools such as ChatGPT, DALLE-2, and

CodeStarter, generative AI has captured
the public imagination in 2023. Unlike
past technologies that have come and
gone—think metaverse—this latest one
looks set to stay. OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, is perhaps
the best-known generative AI tool. It reached 100 million
monthly active users in just two months after launch,
surpassing even TikTok and Instagram in adoption speed,
becoming the fastest-growing consumer application in
history.1

Several innovations inherent within generative AI
have obvious potential benefits for businesses. Its
large language models (LLM) can learn from even
bigger quantities of data than classical AI, including
incorporating information from unstructured inputs.
Users can interact with generative AI tools and receive
responses in natural language. And finally, according to
user needs, generative AI can—as the name indicates—
generate a range of new outputs including text,
pictures, computer code, and data streams.

Such breakthroughs have led to high expectations.
According to a McKinsey report, generative AI could
add $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually in value to the
global economy.2 The banking industry was highlighted
as among sectors that could see the biggest impact (as
a percentage of their revenues) from generative AI. The
technology “could deliver value equal to an additional
$200 billion to $340 billion annually if the use cases
were fully implemented,” says the report.

For businesses from every sector, the current challenge
is to separate the hype that accompanies any new
technology from the real and lasting value it may bring.
This is a pressing issue for firms in financial services.
The industry’s already extensive—and growing—use
of digital tools makes technology advances particularly
likely to affect the sector’s companies.

According to a recent UBS report on the impact
of generative AI, statistics from the U.S. Bureau of
Labor suggest that banks and insurance are among
the industries with the greatest proportion of their
workforces exposed to potential automation.3 This
MIT Technology Review Insights report delves further
into that possibility, examining the early impact of
generative AI within the financial sector, where it is
starting to be applied, and the barriers that need
to be overcome in the long run for its successful
deployment.

The following are the report’s key learnings:

Corporate deployment of generative AI in financial
services is still largely nascent. The most active
use cases revolve around cutting costs by freeing
employees from low-value, repetitive work. Companies
have begun deploying generative AI tools to automate
time-consuming, tedious jobs, which previously required
humans to assess unstructured information. Employees
are thereby freed for more creative work, and in some
cases, the tools outperform people. The following are
common areas of deployment:

MIT Technology Review Insights
5

•  Customer service: Generative AI chatbots are
already deployed to assist human customer service
agents and may soon directly advise customers on basic
questions. An academic study found that they increase
customer service agent productivity and consumer
happiness.

•  Fraud prevention and risk management: The
technology allows software to incorporate a wider and
richer set of data into risk and fraud detection.

•  Coding: Tools that can produce bespoke code for
specific tasks have begun to appear. In a controlled
experiment, an Australian bank found that these raised
programmer productivity by 46%.

Information analysis and summarization:

•
Generative AI tools are already creating summaries of
business conversations—a previously human task. On a
larger scale, BloombergGPT provides the company
another channel to monetize its archives by letting
subscribers search them using natural language
questions.

There is extensive experimentation on potentially
more disruptive tools, but signs of commercial
deployment remain rare. Academics and banks are
examining how generative AI could help in impactful
areas including asset selection, improved simulations,
and better understanding of asset correlation and tail
risk—the probability that the asset performs far below
or far above its average past performance. So far,
however, a range of practical and regulatory challenges
are impeding their commercial use.

Legacy technology and talent shortages may slow
adoption of generative AI tools, but only temporarily.
Many financial services companies, especially
large banks and insurers, still have substantial,
aging information technology and data structures,
potentially unfit for the use of modern applications.
In recent years, however, the problem has eased with
widespread digitalization and may continue to do so.
In addition, newer companies, notably fintechs, do not
face this issue. The burden of legacy technology will
therefore likely diminish, a process that generative AI, if
anything, can accelerate.

As is the case with any new technology, talent with
expertise specifically in generative AI is in short supply
across the economy. For now, financial services
companies appear to be training staff rather than
bidding to recruit from a sparse specialist pool. That
said, the difficulty in finding AI talent is already starting
to ebb, a process that would mirror those seen with the
rise of cloud and other new technologies.

More difficult to overcome may be weaknesses in
the technology itself and regulatory hurdles to its
rollout for certain tasks. Financial services companies
aiming to benefit from generative AI face several
hurdles. First, general, off-the-shelf tools are unlikely to
adequately perform complex, specific tasks, such as
portfolio analysis and selection. Companies will need
to train their own models, a process that will require
substantial time and investment.

Once such software is complete, its output may
be problematic. The risks of bias and lack of
accountability in AI are well known. Finding ways to
validate complex output from generative AI has yet to
see success. Any new tool has to be designed to avoid
violating other actors’ intellectual property (IP) rights;
and generative AI algorithms may act unpredictably—
even illegally—especially when interacting with other
ones. Finally, so-called “hallucinations,” or confident
wrong answers, are a worry with any use of generative
AI. These risks mean that financial services companies
must be cautious in how they deploy generative AI.

Financial regulators are certainly wary about how
these tools may be used. Companies are hoping
for guidance, but this will take time. Authorities
acknowledge that they need to study the implications
of generative AI more, and historically they have rarely
approved tools before rollout. Meanwhile, the possible
benefits of any extensive use of generative AI need to
be weighed against regulatory dangers.

Adoption of generative AI is growing in the financial
services sector, but it is so far limited to automation of
low-value activities where its use can be monitored by
humans or would not pose unacceptable risks.

The promise of
generative AI

To much of the public, the release of ChatGPT in

late 2022 was the first shot in a new
technological revolution. Since then, interest in
generative AI has soared. For example, Google
searches for the term have risen dramatically

in the past year (see Figure 1).

With this interest has come rapid adoption by users
across societies and economies. International Monetary
Fund (IMF) research shows that uptake of ChatGPT
alone—just the most prominent of many generative AI
tools—has been extremely rapid even by the standards
of popular technology adoption (see Figure 2).4

“We tend to overestimate
the impact of any new
technology in the short
run and underestimate it
in the long run.”

Chia Hock Lai, Co-Founder, Global Fintech
Institute

Monetary Fund, 2023.

As with every new technology, a degree of excessive
expectation—and fear—is inevitably driving the
discussion. Chia Hock Lai, co-founder of the Global
Fintech Institute, says he sees a lot of hype now: “We
tend to overestimate the impact of any new technology
in the short run and underestimate it in the long run.”

Time for a more measured assessment
Indeed, Gartner reported in August 2023 that
generative AI had peaked in its emerging technologies
hype cycle, after which it would likely take two to five
years to become integrated into business productivity
tools.5 To an extent, the febrile current discussion
around generative AI, however, obscures some
attributes that will shape its impact.

First, generative AI is a rapidly evolving field: it did not
spring into existence with the release of ChatGPT
and its development is far from complete. McKinsey
describes “a rush to throw money at all things generative
AI” between 2017 and 2022. During those years, private
investments in the technology rose at an average annual
compound rate of 74%, far outstripping the equivalent
growth rate for AI as a whole of 29%.6 Similarly, tools and
products incorporating generative AI have continued to
develop rapidly in recent months (see Figure 3).

Second, generative AI looks set to build on and
supplement existing technologies, rather than
necessarily replace them on a grand scale. As Chia
notes, “you definitely need a clear use case to start
trying out any new technology.” Any such cases will
arise from what generative AI can do compared to
existing tools.

These may be more limited than popular imagination
appreciates. Tools enabled by older versions of AI,
for example are now called “just software,” says John
Mileham, chief technology officer at Betterment, a
robo-advisor that assists users in automated investing.
And such tools have already played a crucial role in
the ongoing digitalization of financial services firms
and other companies. There’s little point in deploying
generative AI where less advanced technologies are
doing the job as effectively and at low cost. Indeed,
some analysts project that, while generative AI will have
a very large economic impact, it will be markedly less
than that of earlier iterations of AI.7

It’s not ‘magic’
The use cases will arise from what generative AI
can deliver that other tools cannot. The striking new
capacity of generative AI is best illustrated by a brief

comparison with older forms of AI. Put simply, older
AI tools can train themselves on huge amounts of
structured data and can answer specific questions
asked in programming-like language.

Generative AI can learn from an even larger body of
information—including unstructured data—and it can
create apparently novel content in response to natural
language questions. Older AI tools, for example, can
tell users if something is a cat. Generative AI can
generate a new image of a cat.

In short, generative AI’s strength is that it allows users
to ask questions in natural language and receive
output that provides readily comprehensive answers
in different formats based on a huge corpus of
information. This can involve, among other things, the

generation of new text, pictures, computer code, or
even large data sets.

The potential value of this creativity is substantial but
should not be overestimated. For example, generative
AI can generate a data set based on existing ones, says
Rama Cont, chair of mathematical finance and head of
the Oxford mathematical and computational finance
group at Oxford University. However, while it may be
even “100 times larger, it won’t have more information,”
he explains. “It can extrapolate to certain situations,
provided you have similar data sets on which to train it.”

In the cat example, the picture will rely on existing
knowledge of cats but will be unable to create something
new. Such extrapolation of existing data “is a nice
feature” of generative AI, says Cont, “but not magic.”

“While later there will be
other, probably more
important, deployments,
a lot of the potential of AI
appears really nascent at
this stage.”

Jason Napier, Head of European Banks
Research, UBS

The road ahead
Generative AI holds out substantial opportunities
for financial services companies. Boston Consulting
Group, for example, projects that the sector is one
of three with the highest potential for growth arising
from the technology in the near term. In particular, the
consultancy argues that generative AI “can generate
personalized investment recommendations, analyze
market data, and test different scenarios to propose
new trading strategies.”8 Certainly, interest exists
for applying generative AI in all these areas. “The
financial sector has been very quick to understand the
usefulness of these tools,” says Cont.

With limited and at most partial exceptions, however,
the industry has not gone beyond experimentation in
such areas. Jason Napier, head of European banks
research at UBS, says that while “later there will be
other, probably more important, deployments, a lot of
the potential of AI appears really nascent at this stage.”

Rather than generative AI revolutionizing the industry
over the short to medium term, companies are focused
on using it to address a range of specific tasks that
typically involve the automation of low value-added
jobs that previously required humans to assess
unstructured information. Interest in doing more exists,
but the still experimental state of generative AI-
powered tools and, equally important, regulatory issues
stand in the way.

Reality check:
Recent deployments
of generative AI

To be useful, any new technology or tool must

solve a problem. So far, generative AI is being
applied to a range of specific tasks or
problems, rather than for the wholesale
design of operating models across entire

companies. This is the case across much of the
economy. McKinsey estimates that roughly three-
quarters of the value created by generative AI overall will
arise from just four areas: customer operations,
marketing and sales, software engineering, and research
and development.9

Cost cuts for now; income generation will
have to wait
Where financial services differ from other sectors is
that generative AI is largely not being used to drive
revenue. According to UBS research, so far “the real
value being seen is from cutting costs.” (see Figure 4).

“We will leverage on
generative AI to change
the anatomy of work,
including our internal
processes, by
automating typically
tedious tasks and
workflows.”

Lito Villanueva, Chief Innovations Officer
and Executive Vice President, RCBC

UBS analysts say generative AI’s main opportunity for the financial sector is lower costs, as staff expenses
represent a relatively high portion of total costs.

According to its assessments of a range of industries
(see Figure 5), the main impact of generative AI lies in
cost cutting, rather than on income generation. This is
true in every part of the sector, including in banking,
wealth management, insurance, and payments.

These savings, in most cases, arise from using
technology to free human employees from the need to
analyze large amounts of often unstructured data and to
produce output in response to directions given in natural
language. “We will leverage on generative AI to change
the anatomy of work, including our internal processes, by
automating typically tedious tasks and workflows,” says
Lito Villanueva, chief innovations officer and executive
vice president at Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation
(RCBC), a Philippines-based bank. RCBC is not alone.

According to a Fortune article published in June 2023,
“so-called generative AI is already helping to speed up
mundane tasks known to crush the spirit of junior Wall
Street employees, hedge funds say—from reviewing
reams of market research to writing basic code and
summarizing fund performance.”10

Eyeing higher-value work
These innovations are not typically designed to reduce
employment levels so much as to give time for staff to
focus on higher-value work. Mileham notes that even
the limited applications deployed at Betterment so
far represent “an unmitigated boon” in the day-to-day
operations of the firm. “There are efficiency benefits
across the board. The value is real, and we get a lot out
of it,” he says.

MIT Technology Review Insights12

“As of yet, it’s not like you’re going to be putting a
generative AI directly in front of customers and
setting it free.”

John Mileham, Chief Technology Officer, Betterment

Another potential improvement is that generative
AI applications may sometimes outperform people
when evaluating unstructured data. A University of
Chicago business school study, for example, found
that a generative AI tool could quickly and accurately
process the implications of bloated financial disclosure
information, which might seek to hide the truth through
verbiage.11

In contrast, academic research into the ability of a
generative AI tool to help customer service operations
found that it increased average productivity in terms of
issue resolution per hour. However, it had “the greatest
impact on novice and low-skilled workers, and minimal
impact on experienced and highly skilled workers.”12 In
other words, it helped new employees get up to speed,
but was less useful to those who already knew the
ropes.

Uses of generative AI in the finance sector
Financial services firms have focused generative AI
deployment on several specific tasks that share the
kind of attributes described above.

Customer service: Chia speaks for many when he
notes “a very strong use case for generative AI in
customer service—going 24/7 for customer service,
even to the extent of providing advice for customers.”
Indeed, the academic research noted above on use
of the technology in customer service found that it
increased the number of issues solved per hour by 14%,
improved client sentiment, and reduced requests for
managerial intervention.13

The most common customer service–related innovation
is the creation of chatbots for either direct use by
customers or company service agents. These tools
represent not so much a new development as an
evolution. At Betterment, for example, a chatbot based
on predictive AI has already “reduced the workload on

our customer service team drastically,” Mileham says,
even before the integration of generative AI. That step
is being considered carefully.

The addition of generative AI elements to chatbots
brings obvious benefits. These include interaction
in natural language and the possible integration of
potentially huge repositories of unstructured data into
the tool’s knowledge base. Accordingly, Villanueva says
that a generative AI–based chatbot is one of RCBC’s
leading digital priorities. That’s because it enables
“real-time quality customer service interactions and
contributes to a seamless customer experience” by
facilitating the filing of complaints, accommodation of
client requests, and collection of relevant customer data.

RCBC is not alone. In May 2023, tech company Kasisto
launched KAI-GPT, the first banking-specific LLM,
and the initial program built to use KAI-GPT was KAI
Answers, which aids employees in replying to customer
queries.14 Meanwhile, various banks have announced
development of generative AI-powered information
tools for the direct use of customers or customer
service agents.15 Similarly, Cowbell Insurance has
launched MooGPT to provide answers to its customers
and agents.16 Most of these tools appear designed
to improve customer-employee interactions rather
than replacing them, except in cases where the aim is
providing basic information.

This is intentional. Two considerations are at play.
First, notes Mileham, any integration of generative AI
into existing chatbots needs to be done safely. “As of
yet, it’s not like you’re going to be putting a generative
AI directly in front of customers and setting it free,”
he says. Second, some financial services firms have
reported an increased need for human customer
service staff. “We’ve seen people wanting more human
interactions for retail transactions instead of fewer,”
says Villanueva. As a result, the Philippines-based

MIT Technology Review Insights
13

bank’s generative AI chatbots are being designed to
“allow our talents to maximize their time and move
toward more highly specified customer concerns that
require more detailed and sensitive attention,” he adds.

Fraud prevention and risk management: For some
years, financial services companies have been using
advanced technologies, including predictive AI, to
improve risk management and fraud prevention.
Generative AI will allow the sector to go further,
including through greater integration of unstructured
data into these efforts. Chia says that using such
information will allow companies to identify new
patterns and anomalies with associated risks at both
a micro level—such as the potential for an individual to
default—and a broader one—such as market trends.

More specifically, according to UBS research, reducing
fraud is key for the payments industry in general.
Visa and PayPal have both deployed generative AI to
prevent fraudulent transactions by blocking suspicious
ones.17 More generally, fintechs such as Datavisor,
Feedzai, and Forter have all integrated generative AI
into their off-the-shelf solutions to reduce payment
fraud.18 At the same time, the new technology allows
the sector to go beyond reinforcing existing anti-fraud
defences, says Villanueva. He adds that RCBC is
hoping to use it to engage customers more actively in
fraud prevention, through more targeted and effective
awareness and education campaigns.

Coding: The financial services industry is, in many
ways, a knowledge-based one. Michael Briest, head of
European technology research at UBS, notes that “as a
sector, banks spend more as a percentage of revenues
on IT than any other, and a lot of banks still do software
design and maintenance in house.” Accordingly, ways
to improve the efficiency of such activities will interest
companies. If properly trained, a generative AI tool can
produce requested computer code as easily as others
can answer questions or generate pictures.

A leading U.S. bank has started using generative AI
tools to help its code developers.19 It is not alone.
Westpac, a large Australian bank, ran a trial with
generative AI to assist its coders and found a 46%
increase in productivity against a control group.20

Mileham says his company, Betterment, uses
generative AI software to help with debugging. They
have also procured GitHub Copilot, a cloud-based AI
tool, to help with code generation and auto-completion.
As with other uses, he stresses that this should happen
only in the context of robust review and testing, and
a person taking ultimate responsibility for any new
code. Even within these constraints, Mileham says it’s
a worthwhile effort. “Everybody who has deployed it
[at Betterment] spends less time banging their heads
against the wall, not knowing the right answer [to
relatively straightforward questions], and more time
being creative,” he explains.

“Definitely, there will be a lot of
automation of routine tasks like
report generation.”

“Some fintech startups have started this model,
sharing or commercializing the generative model but
not the data.”

Rama Cont, Chair of Mathematical Finance and Head of the Oxford Mathematical and
Computational Finance Group, Oxford University

Such subscription tools, however, do raise questions
around how generative AI will change thinking around
the role and value of data. Major news organizations
have taken steps, for example, to block ChatGPT’s
web crawler from accessing their websites.24 On the
other hand, Cont says generative models can now be
shared without revealing the underlying data on which
the model was trained. “Some fintech startups have
started this model, sharing or commercializing the
generative model but not the data,” he explains. “That
is a new possibility.” Ultimately what data is commonly
retained, what is shared, and how, remains a question
for markets—and regulators—to answer.

Diverse forms of information analysis and
summarization: One of the strengths of generative
AI is its ability to use the information in its model to
answer questions. The same capacity is already finding
various uses within financial services. Mileham cites
the example of using generative AI to create the first
draft of summaries following a business meeting or
phone conversation. This, he says, allows a minor,
everyday task to “be compressed into a review rather
than being a drafting exercise.” Similarly, at Man
Group—a large hedge fund—managers have found
that generative AI can speed up initial research by
reviewing academic papers and spotting patterns.21
Meanwhile, a blue-chip Wall Street firm is rolling out
an app to act as a virtual assistant to help wealth
managers find client-relevant research or forms.22
Looking ahead, Chia expects such activity to grow,
saying, “Definitely, there will be a lot of automation of
routine tasks like report generation.”

Beyond this quotidian manipulation of information,
however, will be the opportunity for some businesses
to use generative AI to monetize data. One of the
most high-profile innovations using the technology
in financial services, BloombergGPT, falls into this
category. Subscribers could already access the
company’s large data archive, but this has now been
turned into a specialist LLM for answering questions
related to financial services.23

Only half-speed ahead:
Wariness about more
extensive innovation

While the buzz around generative AI has

somewhat eased in the second half of
2023, optimism still surrounds its
long-term impact. “Generative AI is an
exciting development,” says Mileham.

“There is a lot of opportunity.”

algorithms that beat passive asset selection.26 Risk
management is another field where generative AI is
seeing use as an advanced research tool that goes
beyond its current rollout. Use cases here include trying
to better understand asset correlation27 and tail risk,
among others.28

On the other hand, a distinct disconnect exists between
the current deployment of generative AI with its
perceived potential. Today’s effort will have an effect,
but only on a limited number of functions. Moreover, the
innovation, so far, appears more to be improvements
to current practices than the kind of fintech-driven
disruption seen in payment services and wealth
management in recent years.

While much of the abovementioned activity has
occurred in academia, some companies are
interested as well, at least in principle. UBS, for
example, is researching the use of generative AI
for trading applications. One compelling avenue is
using the technology to express news, in the form of
unstructured text, as a numerical vector in order to
assess its impact on asset prices.

Great expectations
That hasn’t stopped other companies and researchers
from looking further. In Cont’s view, the financial sector
has been quick to adopt new technologies at an
experimental level. “Their deployment could be very
easy as long as they [companies] are comfortable with
the output,” he says.

An area of particular interest is asset selection. One
aspect of this is finding tools that balance portfolio-
wide risk and return.25 Other research seeks to develop

The company’s preliminary results show promise in
improving the ability to forecast volatility changes
driven by incoming news. Meanwhile, a blue-chip Wall
Street firm has applied for a trademark for what it
hopes will be a tool that will advise customers on stock
selection.29 In practice, however, Briest observes that
the banking industry’s restrained approach reflects the
one being taken across the financial services industry
as a whole. “The sector is relatively conservative in
adopting new technological trends,” he says.

Risk management is another field where generative AI
is seeing use as an advanced research tool that goes
beyond its current rollout.

Two general
challenges for new
technology adoption

When grappling with the challenge of

adopting new technologies,
companies often have to tackle the
confluence of legacy technology and
a tight labor market.

Legacy technology
Financial services companies, especially banks, were
among the early adopters of IT decades ago. Choices
made then, though, have long resisted further change.
The most striking example of this phenomenon is that,
as late as 2017, 43% of banking systems relied on
a six-decade-old computer programming language,
COBOL, which was also behind 80% of credit card
transactions and 85% of ATM activity.

Typically, COBOL drove large mainframe computers
because it was the only option decades ago. Although
such arrangements have provided substantial stability,
they make it difficult to add new capabilities arising
from more recent technological developments.30

COBOL encapsulates the broader legacy-technology
deficit in the financial sector. It’s a problem that
encompasses old software and siloed data storage
arrangements that have evolved to meet challenges
across decades but are no longer fit for purpose.

According to an Accenture survey of large banks, even
though the respondent pool consisted of companies
interested in cloud usage, only 31% had moved more
than half of their previous mainframe activity to the new
platforms.31 “A lot of banks maintain old IT systems,” says
Briest. “We’re hearing from technology companies about
a lot of pilot projects starting and companies moving
quite quickly to the next step, but this is going to take
some time.” It’s an observation shared by Chia. “Most
financial services organizations have a lot of data that is
usually poorly structured or even fragmented,” he says.

Despite this enduring challenge of legacy IT for many
companies, the problem has been diminishing across
the industry because of extensive digitalization in recent
years. “A lot of financial services firms have invested
heavily in digital transformation,” says Chia. “Most have
gained a certain capability in data management and
there’s already a level of fundamental readiness in terms
of technology investment.”

One of them is RCBC, which was established in 1960.
“The past three years have been pivotal for our digital
transformation,” says Villanueva. “The introduction and
expansion of generative AI solutions will be smooth
and easy.” Meanwhile, new entrants do not have a
technological deficit to overcome. Mileham says that

More generally, companies have a big opportunity to
use “generative AI to accelerate the shift off some
legacy applications that maybe it was just cost-
prohibitive to consider previously.”

Michael Briest, Head of European Technology Research, UBS

Betterment, as a cloud-native company, can deploy
generative AI as broadly as it sees a use for it relatively
quickly. “I’m confident that major cloud providers are
going to be able to productize these capabilities and
expose them to companies very efficiently,” he says.
Cont also says that he believes that financial companies
are, overall, “pretty ready” to make use of generative AI.

Even those who currently are not in such a state may
be able to use the technology to help modernize
existing IT infrastructure. Generative AI itself,
notably its ability to generate code, can help with the
transformation away from legacy systems and data
storage.32 More generally, says Briest, companies have
a big opportunity to use “generative AI to accelerate the
shift off some legacy applications that maybe it was just
cost-prohibitive to consider previously.”

A tight talent market
Another challenge around adoption of new technology
is a lack of talent and expertise. “Currently, generative
AI is so new that you can’t really hire a whole lot of
experience,” says Mileham. Villanueva agrees that
“it is challenging to find talent because of the highly
competitive labor market.”

Despite the current shortage in generative AI talent,
some see this as an expected problem, common to
every industry. “I don’t see it as a long-term problem,”
says Briest. He explains that the same talent shortage
has accompanied the appearance of other new
technologies, such as cloud, but that a supply of the
necessary talent has developed. An April 2023 survey
indicates that for generative AI, finding talent is already
growing easier (see Figure 6).

Experts say that as the technology evolves over time,
finding talent could become less of a problem. First,
new entrants into the workforce will increasingly have
been educated with the technology in mind. At the
same time, while generative AI is new, it overlaps with
other fields of AI and machine learning.

The past can offer some lessons, says Cont. Consider,
for example, financial services professionals using
earlier AI to conduct simulations for investment banks.
“A lot of quants switched to data scientist roles,” he
says. “They just changed their business cards. There’s
not a shortage of people. The tech is new, but the math
and computational foundations are not.”

Responses in McKinsey’s survey suggest that hiring tech talent has become somewhat easier since 2022.

Meanwhile, companies like RCBC are looking to
develop internally the skills needed to use generative
AI tools. Villanueva says the bank’s approach
contributes to employee satisfaction with the new
technology. “RCBC has its Digital Academy providing
the best-in-class and relevant trainings for its human
resources,” he adds.

At Betterment, letting people develop their own skills
is designed to help both employees and the company.
“Our thought is to get the technology into people’s
hands so that they can start to become the experts,”
says Mileham.

Tech-specific
challenges and the
regulatory hurdle

Generative AI applications appear

impressive, but they are general-purpose
tools that do not address most of the
specific needs of financial services
companies. “There are different use cases

within financial services that will need to use some
proprietary data and not the very general kind of data
that ChatGPT is using,” says Chia. Companies will need
to be prepared for the fact that they’re not going to get
immediate results when they start investing in the
technology, he warns: “It takes a long time to have a
high-quality model.”

Importance of customization
Companies like Betterment will likely need to create
distinct tools to address different uses. “We wouldn’t
create an ‘everything machine’ that has all of our
customer information in it for anybody to draw from,”
says Mileham. “That wouldn’t be a good practice for
a serious financial institution.” Even once those use-
specific models are in place, Chia says the work doesn’t
end there. “In financial services, you will always have
new products and new processes, which means that
there will always be a need to retrain the models,” he
explains.

The difficulties seen in market simulation software
illustrate some of the likely, wider challenges for
generative AI. According to Cont, while generative AI
tools can create new data sets, they will not include
any new information if, for example, a company wants
better insight into tail risk. More broadly, he adds, users
can’t just hope that a generic algorithm will extract
what is needed for a niche use. “If you don’t target
what you want to learn, you may not learn it,” Cont
explains. “You have to ask what you want to use output
for and then create a bespoke algorithm tailored to the
intended use case. When you generate cat pictures
from generative AI, you don’t want a mutant cat, but
in financial applications you are typically interested in
extreme events.”

Reliability, bias, and accountability
Additionally, checking the reliability of the output
presents important challenges for activities that use
substantial amounts of generated data. “There is no
easy way to validate the output,” says Cont. “If you
want to feed these into a risk management framework
or a portfolio optimization problem, you’d better make
sure that the output correctly captures the risk of the
portfolio. That isn’t obvious at all.”

“In financial services, you will always have new
products and new processes, which means that there
will always be a need to retrain the models.”

Other challenges with the technology, according to
Mileham, include the “classic” issues of AI such as bias
and accountability. According to a recent IMF study,
generative AI, if anything, exacerbates these problems.
The far greater breadth of data used to train LLMs, for
example, leads to a greater theoretical possibility of
bias. Similarly, the higher complexity of its architecture
and decision-making processes compared to previous
AI makes the reasoning behind given output more
opaque.33 “Very often, the sophisticated models of deep
learning are black boxes,” says Chia.

Generative AI also poses its own specific challenges.
These may arise even when the technology is working
as planned. A recent study co-authored by Cont shows
that algorithms that have learned from a common set
of data—such as the history of asset prices—may end
up synchronizing as if they were a cartel even though
they are not communicating. “If an algorithm learns to
manipulate prices, can you sue anybody?” asks Cont.
“It is a legal nightmare. This is one of the questions
we are just beginning to study.”34 Worse still, the
potential for a herd-like response inherent in such an
unconsciously coordinated response could present a
threat to financial stability under a worst-case scenario,
according to IMF research.35 Meanwhile, if generative AI
sees increasing use for automated decision-making, it
is likely to attract a high number of adversarial attacks.36

Intellectual property rights and
hallucinations
Useful answers produced by generative AI may violate
the IP rights of other actors, depending on the inputs
used for training the model. Already, several artists
have launched lawsuits based on the inclusion of their
works in training data.37 Meanwhile, if a generative AI
tool is trained on licensed software and generates new
code, that may violate the IP rights of the licensor. At
the same time, it is not a straightforward question in law
if a company can license software created within its
computer systems by generative AI with minimal or no
human intervention.38

Finally, things do not always work as planned.
“Hallucinations are the key bit,” says Mileham, referring
to incorrect content that can be generated confidently
by AI, which brings substantial risk. A lawyer in U.S.
federal court relying on ChatGPT recently submitted
an affidavit in a personal injury lawsuit that included six
fake cases. This led to substantial news coverage for

the firm and potential sanctions.39 Hallucinations are a
known problem but, so far, research to address them
has focused on specific cases rather than the general
issue.40

These kinds of issues make rapid adoption of
generative AI tools across a wider range of functions
irresponsible. “Institutional leaders must first assess
the safety and security of these tools, and address
any forthcoming challenges or risks,” says Villanueva.

Regulatory risks of a new technology
Accountability is at the core of industry thinking on the
rollout of generative AI. UBS research points to potential
regulation as the main barrier to adoption of generative
AI in the fintech space. Others argue that the same
could be said of the entire financial sector. “AI is not
an easy button to use to bypass the accountability
that we have to our customers,” says Mileham.

Regulators strongly agree. In a July 2023 speech,
the chief executive of the UK’s Financial Conduct
Authority (FCA) reiterated: “While the FCA does not
regulate technology, we do regulate the effect on—
and use of—tech in financial services.... With these
developments [the growing use of generative AI], it is
critical we do not lose sight of our duty to protect the
most vulnerable and to safeguard financial inclusion
and access.”41 A month earlier, the U.S. Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau warned that, with the
applications already being put in place, “financial
institutions risk violating legal obligations, eroding
customer trust, and causing consumer harm when
deploying chatbot [sic] technology.”42 Meanwhile, the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has invited
discussion on proposed new regulations regarding
AI-enabled tools.43

Accordingly, financial services companies are looking
to regulators for guidance on how they can use the
technology. “We have to start the AI project with a
view toward being regulatorily compliant,” says Chia.
“There will be growing regulatory content so it is
imperative for financial services to be able to engage
regulators effectively on what kind of rules and
standards there should be.” Mileham adds, “It’s going
to be helpful to see regulators looking at this seriously
and ensuring that all of the actors in these fields with
fiduciary responsibilities understand the depth of
those responsibilities.”

Conclusion: Valuable
tool, but yet to be fully
disruptive

The arrival of generative AI as a viable

technology is important news for the financial
services industry. Its application, however, will
for now be limited to specific uses where
other, cheaper technologies are not already

sufficient for requirements and where the weaknesses of
the technology do not put off executives and regulators.
The difficulty in providing a more detailed forecast is the
uncertainty in how today’s failings might be overcome.

The strengths of generative AI shape its current
application. In particular, with the capacity to learn
from large amounts of unstructured data and to create
output of various kinds, it is already beginning to play
an important role in customer service support, fraud
prevention, risk management, code generation, and
unstructured data analysis. Its impact in these use
cases should not be underestimated simply because
the technology is not being deployed more widely.
As generative AI is rolled out further in these areas,
substantial cost savings—up to $340 billion annually
across the financial services industry—are likely from
the shift in human employment away from repetitive,
low-value tasks toward more creative and profitable
ones. In that sense, it is no exaggeration to say, in
Mileham’s words, “This is a big moment.”

Compared to what might eventually be possible,
however, “we are only scratching the surface at the
moment,” says Briest. The use of generative AI in more
sensitive tasks closer to the core of financial service
business models—such as making decisions on, or
executing, investment strategy for clients or companies
themselves—remains some way off. Too many questions
hang over the technology itself for companies or
regulators to give it free rein any time soon. Villaneuva
also urges caution. “As exciting as this technology is, we
must be wary before fully realizing the benefits,” he says.

Nevertheless, generative AI continues to evolve quickly,
and solutions to its drawbacks may rapidly emerge.
It is very likely, for example, that ways will be found
to reduce the number and extent of hallucinations,
although some errors appear to be inevitable.44 If such
problems do persist, the technology might still find
new uses in financial services, as long as the potential
drawbacks are fully understood by all parties. “We’ll
have to figure out as a culture, and within the regulatory
regime, what that should mean,” says Mileham. “It might
be that people just get comfortable with the constraints
of AI and you’re able to, with a straight face, disclose
to a customer that this thing is useful, but it is also
potentially flawed, so take it with a grain of salt.”

As generative AI and societal attitudes inter-evolve,
financial services companies should reap the substantial,
if constrained, benefits of the new technology while
keeping an eye on where it might head.

The use of generative AI in
more sensitive tasks closer
to the core of financial
service business models—
such as making decisions
on, or executing, investment
strategy for clients or
companies themselves—
remains some way off.
